"""File purpose:
    Provide the stable public order-execution API used by the strategy runner.

Key responsibilities:
    - Re-export public order models and helpers from ``order_manager_core``.
    - Expose ``RuntimeOrderManager`` as the single production ``OrderManager``.

Operational constraints:
    - This facade must not add a second execution path or duplicate order state.
    - Runtime recovery and entry gating remain owned by ``RuntimeOrderManager``.
