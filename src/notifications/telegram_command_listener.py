"""
Backward-compatibility wrapper for the Telegram controller.

In the original codebase, the Telegram bot command listener was a
standalone script. This refactored version rolls command handling
directly into ``TelegramController``. The separate listener is
therefore no longer required, but this file remains to avoid import
errors for existing tooling.

Running this module directly will simply instantiate a ``TelegramController``
and begin polling for commands. The controller does not perform any
trading itself; instead, it logs incoming commands.
