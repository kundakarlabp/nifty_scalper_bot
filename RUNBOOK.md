# Runbook

## Rotate Zerodha tokens
1. `./manage_bot.sh token`
2. Follow the URL to log in and retrieve the `request_token`.
3. Paste the token when prompted; `.env` is updated with `ZERODHA__ACCESS_TOKEN`.
4. Restart the bot.

## Kill switch
- Live trading is on by default. Set `ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING=false` (or `ENABLE_TRADING=false`) before launch to avoid placing real orders.
- Send `/stop` via Telegram for an immediate halt.

## Restart procedure
1. Ensure environment variables are set in `.env`.
2. `./manage_bot.sh run`
3. Verify `curl localhost:8000/health` returns JSON.

## Post-deploy log verification
After each deployment, review recent logs and confirm:

1. `quote_diag` emits bid/ask details for a token, the subsequent `micro` line references the same token, and it does **not** report `reason=no_quote`.
2. `micro` log entries display a lot size of `75` for NIFTY.
3. The exposure `cap_pct` printed by both `gates` and `micro` logs matches exactly.
4. `resubscribe` messages for any token appear no more than once every 10â€“15 seconds.
5. There are no `UnboundLocalError` messages or crashes.
6. When trades are skipped, the log notes a confidence score below the configured threshold rather than `no_quote`.

## Common failure modes
- **Network down**: health check fails or no ticks. Verify connectivity and restart.
- **Broker reject**: order API returns an error. Review logs and `/apihealth` for circuit breaker status.
- **Stale ticks**: `/status` shows old timestamps. Restart data feed using the restart procedure.
- **No warm-up bars**: The bot requires market-hour ticks to build warm-up bars. When running with `DATA__WARMUP_DISABLE=true`, allow ~30 minutes of live ticks before trading. Use `/why` or `/force_eval` to diagnose or trigger evaluation.
